# React-Dark-and-Light-Mode
Dark mode has become the necessity of these days and i have developed this dark and light mode component with switch as well as icons. The Material UI package has been used for development.
## Toggle Button 
The toggle button changes the theme from light to dark that is basically a switch from Material UI. 
## Sun and Moon Icons 
The Sun icon represents the light theme and when you click on it then it switches to dark mode and also replaces with Moon icon. 
## Text Changes
In Light mode the text appears black and in dark mode it also changes to white. 
You can easily use this component in your projects.
